# EEG Consciousness Mode (ECM) – Alpha

Early-stage alpha prototype of the EEG Consciousness Mode system based on Covello Theory.

## Core Features
- Real-time EEG waveform visualization
- Dynamic Covello Metrics:
  - **CIndex** (Consciousness Integration Index)
  - **PRI** (Projection Recursion Index)
  - **QES** (Quality of Experience Score)
- Collapse Event Prediction Engine (CEPE)
- Band power plots across standard frequency ranges
- Fully adaptive metric logic for real EEG data

## Usage
Run `ecm_main.py` with an `.edf` EEG file (e.g. `seizure1.edf`) to see metrics and waveforms live.

## Disclaimer
This is an alpha release for demonstration and Kickstarter launch purposes. Not for clinical use (yet).

## License
The ECM prototype is released under a limited-use license for research, demo, and educational purposes only. Commercial or clinical reuse is prohibited without written permission. All core intellectual property is © 2025 Covello Theory.
