# EEG Consciousness Mode (ECM) ‚Äì Alpha

Early-stage alpha prototype of the EEG Consciousness Mode (ECM) system, a real-time consciousness metric analyzer built on Covello Theory. This research tool maps EEG activity into dynamically evolving cognitive metrics ‚Äî including integration, recursion, and perceptual clarity.

## Core Features
- Real-time EEG waveform visualization
- Dynamic Covello Metrics:
  - **CIndex** (Consciousness Integration Index)
  - **PRI** (Projection Recursion Index)
  - **QES** (Quality of Experience Score)
- Collapse Event Prediction Engine (CEPE)
- Band power plots across standard frequency ranges
- Fully adaptive metric logic for real EEG data

## Usage
Run `ecm_main.py` with an `.edf` EEG file (e.g. `real_eeg_2.edf`) to see metrics and band powers in real time.

## üé• ECM Alpha Live Demo

![Watch the demo](./ecm_demo.mp4)

This video shows the ECM Alpha prototype processing real EEG data and visualizing Covello Theory metrics in real time.
‚ö†Ô∏è ECM Alpha has been tested on a limited set of EEG files (.edf) and may require format-specific adjustments. Broader compatibility and resilience across diverse EEG sources is under active development.
Note: ECM Alpha currently supports a subset of .edf files with consistent channel labeling and structure. For demonstration or testing purposes, please use the provided example file or contact us for compatibility guidance.

## EEG Data and Interpretation

ECM Alpha analyzes real EEG signals (EDF format) using spectral decomposition and live metric modeling.
- Band powers reflect **standard clinical frequency ranges** (Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta, Gamma)  
- Custom metrics ‚Äî **CIndex (Consciousness Integration Index)**, **PRI (Projection Recursion Index)**, and **QES (Quality of Experience Score)** ‚Äî are derived from Covello Theory and normalized between 0 and 1.  
- All values are computed dynamically and updated continuously in a sliding time window.
- This system is under active development and will be optimized further for multi-channel support, signal normalization, and live metric responsiveness.

This system is designed to be readable and interpretable by neuroscientists, EEG technicians, and research professionals alike.
