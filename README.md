# EEG Consciousness Mode (ECM) ‚Äì Alpha

Alpha-stage prototype of the EEG Consciousness Mode (ECM) system ‚Äî a real-time analyzer that applies Covello Theory to EEG data. ECM dynamically maps integration, recursion, and perceptual coherence into quantifiable cognitive metrics.

## Core Features
- Real-time EEG waveform visualization
- Dynamic Covello Metrics:
  - **CIndex** (Consciousness Integration Index)
  - **PRI** (Projection Recursion Index)
  - **QES** (Quality of Experience Score)
- Collapse Event Prediction Engine (CEPE)
- Band power plots across standard frequency ranges
- Fully adaptive metric logic for real EEG data

## Usage
Run `ecm_main.py` with an `.edf` EEG file (e.g. `real_eeg_2.edf`) to see metrics and band powers in real time.

## üé• ECM Alpha System Preview

![Watch the demo](./ecm_demo.mp4)

This internal demo shows the ECM Alpha prototype processing real EEG data and visualizing Covello Theory metrics ‚Äî CIndex, PRI, and QES ‚Äî in real time. The signal was processed live during recording, with real-time updates to band powers, Covello Metrics, and collapse prediction logic.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: This is a pre-recorded internal demonstration. EEG input file used is not publicly released. The video reflects system behavior observed during controlled test conditions.


## EEG Data and Interpretation

ECM Alpha analyzes real EEG signals (EDF format) using spectral decomposition and live metric modeling.
- Band powers reflect **standard clinical frequency ranges** (Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta, Gamma)  
- Custom metrics ‚Äî **CIndex (Consciousness Integration Index)**, **PRI (Projection Recursion Index)**, and **QES (Quality of Experience Score)** ‚Äî are derived from Covello Theory and normalized between 0 and 1.  
- All values are computed dynamically and updated continuously in a sliding time window.
- This system is under active development and will be optimized further for multi-channel support, signal normalization, and live metric responsiveness.

This system is designed to be readable and interpretable by neuroscientists, EEG technicians, and research professionals alike.
